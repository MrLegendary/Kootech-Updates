The truth is, the majority of file hosts in Genesis are provided for free and have limited bandwidth capabilities. These sites limit the download speed you are allowed to access them with and limit the quality of files that can be uploaded. As well, Genesis is a popular add-on and thousands of people are trying to use the same streams at the same time. All of these factors cause routine buffering.

If you are willing to try it, there is a PREMIUM option that eliminates these issues and make add-ons such as Genesis buffer free and high quality: Real-Debrid on Kodi.

Real-Debrid is a paid service that gives you premium access to a large number of popular file hosts on the internet. Your fee goes to maintaining and paying for those servers, so your download speeds are not limited and uploads are not capped to save space.
